# LimitTable

A module for ProcessWire CMS/CMF. Allows limits and restrictions to be placed on selected Profields Table fields.

For any Table field you can limit the number of rows that may be added and also prevent the use of drag-sorting and the trashing of rows. If a limit has been defined then there is an option to show all (empty) rows up to that limit.

This module does not support paginated Table fields.

## Usage

[Install](http://modules.processwire.com/install-uninstall/) the LimitTable module.

The module configuration screen should be self-explanatory.

You can add rows in the module config as needed using the "Add another row" button.

Please note that limits and restrictions are applied with CSS/JS so should not be considered tamper-proof.
